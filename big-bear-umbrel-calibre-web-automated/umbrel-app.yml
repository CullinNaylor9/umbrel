  Calibre, while a fantastic tool for its age, has several problems when containerised, including its reliance on a KasmVNC server instance for the UI, which is near   
  impossible to use on mobile and is relatively resource-heavy if you're running a small, lower power server like I am.
  
   For many, Calibre-Web has really swooped in to save the day, offering an alternative to a containerised Calibre instance that's resource-light and with a much more modern UI       
   to boot.
  
    However, when compared to full-fat Calibre, it unfortunately lacks a few core features leading many to run both services in parallel,
    each serving to fill in where the other lacks, resulting in an often clunky, imperfect solution.
